# NetworkMonitoringService Documentation

## Overview

`NetworkMonitoringService.swift` is a Swift file that defines a service for monitoring network connectivity in iOS applications. It uses the Network and OSLog frameworks for network monitoring and logging, respectively. This service is designed to be observable by SwiftUI views or other components.

## Components

### NetworkMonitoringService
- **Type:** final class, subclass of NSObject, conforms to ObservableObject.
- **Purpose:** Monitors network connectivity and provides updates on network state changes.
- **Properties:**
  - `log`: A logger instance for logging network state changes.
  - `networkState`: A `@Published` property that stores the current network state.
  - `networkStatePublisher`: A Combine publisher to handle network state updates.
  - `pathMonitor`: An instance conforming to `NetworkPathMonitorProtocol` for actual network monitoring.
  - `queue`: A DispatchQueue where network monitoring tasks are executed.
- **Functions:**
  - `init(pathMonitor:)`: Initializes the service with a network path monitor.
  - `cancel()`: Stops the network monitoring.
  - `start()`: Starts monitoring network changes and updates the `networkState`.

### NetworkPath
- **Type:** struct.
- **Purpose:** Represents a network path with a status.
- **Properties:**
  - `status`: Stores the network status.

### NetworkPathMonitorProtocol
- **Type:** protocol.
- **Purpose:** Abstracts network path monitoring functionality.
- **Requirements:**
  - `networkPathPublisher`: A Combine publisher for network paths.
  - `start()`: Starts network path monitoring.
  - `stop()`: Stops network path monitoring.

### PathCreation
- **Type:** final class, conforms to `NetworkPathMonitorProtocol`.
- **Purpose:** Concrete implementation of `NetworkPathMonitorProtocol` using `NWPathMonitor`.
- **Properties:**
  - `networkPathPublisher`: A Combine publisher for network paths.
  - `subject`: A PassthroughSubject used for network path updates.
  - `monitor`: An instance of `NWPathMonitor` for actual network monitoring.
- **Functions:**
  - `start()`: Sets up and starts the network path monitoring.
  - `stop()`: Cancels the network monitoring.

## Usage

- `NetworkMonitoringService` can be instantiated and used in SwiftUI views or other components to observe network connectivity changes.
- It leverages Combine for reactive updates to network state changes.
- Custom implementations of `NetworkPathMonitorProtocol` can be provided for testing or different monitoring strategies.
